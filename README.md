# Github-contributers-parser
A bash script to extract the names and the emails of the contributors of specified GitHub repositories.
Note: This script was a practice on a bash scripting course I took.
-------------------------------------------------------
usage:
1- clone the repository
2- put the links of github repositories you want to extract the date from 
   in  github_links_here.txt
3- make sure that both emailCollector.sh and fetchLogs.sh are excutable
   on linux you can use chmod command
4- run emailCollector.sh
5- let the magic happen
6- the output (if exists) will be in a new file in the same 
   directory called developersInfo.txt
