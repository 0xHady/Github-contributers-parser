A bash script to extract the names and the emails of the contributors of specified GitHub repositories.
-------------------------------------------------------
Note: This script was a practice on a bash scripting course I took.

usage:<br />
1- clone the repository<br />
2- put the links of github repositories you want to extract the date from in  github_links_here.txt<br />
3- make sure that both emailCollector.sh and fetchLogs.sh are excutable on linux you can use chmod command<br />
4- run emailCollector.sh<br />
5- let the magic happen<br />
6- the output (if exists) will be in a new file in the same directory called developersInfo.txt<br />
